# WWEasy-MK.II
Software to aid WWE stock purchasing decisions

This project will be done in mostly in Scala, except for the web scraping which will be done in ~~Python~~ Java.

#### Personal Challenges
  1. Minimize imports
  2. Make code as functional as possible

This will first be a simple CLI application, ~~but will later be made a desktop application using JavaFX.~~

JavaFX requires too many dependencies that I don't wish to inflict on the user; 
this will instead be made a web application using the Play framework

Thanks to Alvin Alexander for the books and the resources that made this project possible.
